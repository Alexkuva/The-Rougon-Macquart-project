The Rougon Maquart's project

"L'Histoire naturelle et sociale d'une famille sous le Second Empire: les Rougon-Macquart". Inspired by the series of book of Emile Zola, The Rougon Maquart's project is a repository  whose goal is to share knowledge, architectures, best practice, links, articles ... related to cloud technologies.

The aim of the project is to share knowledge and to provide turnkey architectures or technologies.
This repo's goal not to hint, nor give a theoretical model of the architecture, but to provide a terraform-able end to end solution

I hope tech benchmarks can be achieved through this project.

The project goes by the following folders (others technologies or architectures will be provided through time):

- Architecture
    - Azure
    - AWS
    - GCP
- Technologies
    - MongoDB
    - Databricks
